##azure-endpoints

- Utilizes this script template+logging:  http://powershell.com/cs/media/p/3950.aspx 

- This script allows you to transfer azure endpoints, plus ACLs from one machine to another by selecting your source and target, subscriptions, services and machines.  
- It will also output the endpoints into a VMName_log for your review. 
- Run the resulting powershell as is or adjust as you need to generate the endpoints along with the ACLs on the target system.
- You can pass the script a debug flag to continue testing with fixed source and target values.
